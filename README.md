Description:
This is my portfolio. I have a nav bar and a footer, along with two main section elements. One of the section elements sits to the left side of the page, the other takes up the rest of the room. The footer is at the bottom.
This is a website for my portfolio. it contains information about me, where to reach me, and the projects ive been working on.
